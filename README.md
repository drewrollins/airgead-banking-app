# airgead-banking-app
An app to calculate user investment data given x amount of years.


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project took me longer than I care to admit. While I had an immense amount of stress from my personal life, I managed to fix the errors I was experiencing over   time. The main problem I struggled with was calculating the yearly interest and printing that value seperate from the total. 
 
 

What did you do particularly well?
I wrote the fucntions to perform most calculations and the printed menu quickly. This took relatively little time compared to the interest problem I had.



Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could decrease the size of main dramatically by implementing the print menu into a function and the call on that function instead of implementing it in main.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
This goes back to the first question for me. I struggles the most with calculating and storing the yearly interest by itself. I used numerous resources to help me      work out the problem. I consulted with a programming friend of mine that helped me work through it. We both have the same programming knowledge, it was a learning      experience and a challenge for us both.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
All of it. Encapsulation is everything im discovering.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This I fell has never really been an inssue for me. I write readable and clean code as I go. Sometimes I'll clean up white space to condense like objects or variables    together just to group things that are similar.
